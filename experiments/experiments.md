(This is how the micro-bit works on screen)

#### Reflection ####

This is my first experiment with microbit. I have learned the coding strucuture which describes the switch buttons and LED matrix.SW1 was set as Button A, SW2 was set as Button B. I understand that Edge pin 0V worked as GND pin.
I tried to modified the code in order to change the duration of the LED but I could not find the proper code.

### Experiment 2###

(Dimming a LED using a potentiometer)

#### Photo of completed project ####
In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.
