# Inventor Kit Experiments


### Experiment 01 ###

The code what I made in the Microsoft MadeCode

This is how the micro-bit works

#### Reflection ####

This is my first experiment with microbit. I have learned the coding strucuture which describes the switch buttons and LED matrix.SW1 was set as Button A, SW2 was set as Button B. I understand that Edge pin 0V worked as GND pin.
I tried to modified the code in order to change the duration of the LED but I could not find the proper code.

### Experiment 2 ###

## Dimming a LED using a potentiometer ##

(The circuit on the breadboard and how LED worked)

(I moved the S1 switch and sentting of the jump wires.then I confirmed it was still working.)

#### Reflection ####
It was very difficult to find out which was the flatside of the LED. Now I found out that the short leg side is the flat side. Also I have noticed the LED has own light strengh depends on their color. Red has most strong light.
And I struggled to find which is the POT conponent. This was because I had to connect the knob to the POT part. 
Now I have learned the coding and how swith works(ON/OFF). I am not sure How Digital to Analog Converter works. I understand in the code which discribes: analogue write pins to digital write pin.. However, I need to look further.

### Experiment 3 ###

## Using a transister to drive a motor ##

Fan was spinning! Slowing down and speeding up!

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learned that the role of transister. Transister could convert weak electrical signals into strong signals, that why the motor could work with Microbit. I am prerry sure transister could be used any situation when I want to create something which has some movement.


### Experiment 4 ###

## Using the accelerometer to control motor speed

In the code below, replace imagemissing.jpg with the name of the image, which should be in the kitexperiments folder.

Fan started moving when accelerometer detect the deirections.
